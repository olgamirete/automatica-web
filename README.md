## Technologies used:

- TypeScript (because it's marvelous âœ¨).
- React (because it just works ðŸš€).
- Bootstrap & Sass (because it's easy to use).
- React Three Fiber (for animating with hardware acceleration).
- SendGrid (for sending confirmation emails).
- PHP (minimal backend to connect with SendGrid).
